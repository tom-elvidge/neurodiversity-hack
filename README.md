# Visua
Notes application with data visualization tools to aid processing numbers.

This application was created as part of the AstraZeneca 2021 Neurodiversity Hackathon. The team chose to design a solution for Sara Light, a senior sales executive that lives with Dyscalculia.

# What is Visua? 
Visua was created as an alternative to Google Keep, introducing a way to bring context to otherwise contextless numbers and data.

The goal of this codebase was to demonstrate some of the visualisations that could be used. Dates are displayed with clear icons; Monetary values are detected and are displayed using vvarious sizes of gold coin piles; Phone numbers are identified and highlighted.

If given time, we were hoping to implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for deep learning to increase accuracy.
